  - implementation: Channel
    description: >
        This benchmark uses a channel to synchronize the goroutines.
        The channel is used as a lock, so only one goroutine can access the counter at the same time.

  - implementation: Mutex
    description: >
        This benchmark uses a `sync.Mutex` to lock the counter, before accessing it.
        This makes sure, that only one goroutine can access the counter at the same time.
